    "description": "Dr. Mahzabeen Emu, an accomplished PhD graduate and valued member of the GOAL Lab alumni community, was recently awarded the Governor General’s Academic Gold Medal at her PhD convocation at Queen’s University. This accolade marks her second Governor General’s Gold Medal in Canada, having previously received one for her Master’s degree, and her third academic gold medal overall—an extraordinary achievement underscoring her academic excellence and dedication.\n\nAdding to the significance of the moment, her PhD supervisor, Dr. Kai Salomaa, was simultaneously honored with the Excellence in Graduate Supervision Award, making the convocation ceremony an especially memorable milestone for both mentor and student. Dr. Emu also expressed deep gratitude to her supervisors, Dr. Salimur Choudhury and Dr. Kai Salomaa, and acknowledged the continued support from her academic community throughout her journey.\n\nDr. Emu has now embarked on a new chapter of her career as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). She is actively seeking to recruit graduate students (PhD and Master’s level), both domestic and international, to work on cutting-edge research in the areas of Quantum Computing and Optimization."
